<hr>

#### Basic React Knowledge
- `node_modules` folder is external library and package's, build tool's,
    utility library etc, it's just contain external library our project relies on.
- we import app.jsx to main.jsx so that we can access App.jsx.
- remember we need to export statement in the App.jxs file.



#### Step By Step Environment setup.
- First i install node js,
- than change directory nad run the code `npm create vite@latest`,
- than i choose `react`,
- and than i choose `javascript`,
- than `cd` what i was create for my react project file name,
- and than run the code `npm install`,
- after run this code `npm run dev`,
- <b>now environment is ready</b>.
- we export because what we want use in the future in every component.
- we use import because what we take from component.

#### Restart Server.
- first i need to ensure to right `pwd`
- than `npm run dev`
- it will start the server.


## What was my fault and what i learn in this project.
- i was forget to change directory to my new making react file and chack `pwd`
- in function return i take <div> to take multiple string.
- and i can use () in return funtion.
- external CSS file should be on Public folder.
- i was not make css file in public folder and link to html file,
  that's why it wasn't work.
- for scr style file i have to import form that file i use in css.  
- in function return we use parenthesis `()`;
- if i need js const in function i need to take const or variable in the function `{}` 
- in `{}` we can use js builtIn function also.
- we use javascript function like uppercase function.
