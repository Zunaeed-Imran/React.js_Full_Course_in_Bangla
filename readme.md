## What was my fault and what i learn in this project.
- i was forget to change directory to my new making react file and chack `pwd`
- in function return i take <div> to take multiple string.
- and i can use () in return funtion.
- external CSS file should be on Public folder.
- i was not make css file in public folder and link to html file,
  that's why it wasn't work.
- for scr style file i have to import form that file i use in css.  
- in function return we use parenthesis `()`;
- if i need js const in function i need to take const or variable in the function `{}` 
- in `{}` we can use js builtIn function also.
- we use javascript function like uppercase function.
- if we use image in react we have to import image first, than use in js variable name by calling.
- we use proops as JS object.
- using proops we can pass new value in the component.
- using proops sring can be in `name="string"` but number should be in `age={26}`
- Default Prop will can show default set value.
- by prop calling we can call variable form other page.
