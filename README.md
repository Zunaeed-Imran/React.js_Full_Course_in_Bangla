## React.js Full Course in Bangla.

#### Lectured by: Anisul Islam Rubel & Bro Code.

<hr>

#### Basic React Knowledge

- `node_modules` folder is external library and package's, build tool's, utility
  library etc, it's just contain external library our project relies on.
- we import app.jsx to main.jsx so that we can access App.jsx.
- remember we need to export statement in the App.jxs file.

#### Step By Step Environment setup.

- First i install node js,
- than change directory nad run the code `npm create vite@latest`,
- than i choose `react`,
- and than i choose `javascript`,
- than `cd` what i was create for my react project file name,
- and than run the code `npm install`,
- after run this code `npm run dev`,
- <b>now environment is ready</b>.
- we export because what we want use in the future in every component.
- we use import because what we take from component.
- [Nodejs install from ubuntu](https://youtu.be/NS3aTgKztis?si=IPOV09zYbFjHcmj-)

#### Restart Server and some shortcut.

- first i need to ensure to right `pwd`
- than `npm run dev`
- it will start the server.
- [if clone a React reppo i have to `npm install` in terminal]
- `rcc` is command for class component make.
- `rfc` is for functional component make.

## What was my fault and what i learn in this project.

- i was forget to change directory to my new making react file and chack `pwd`
- in function return i take <div> to take multiple string.
- and i can use () in return funtion.
- external CSS file should be on Public folder.
- i was not make css file in public folder and link to html file, that's why it
  wasn't work.
- for scr style file i have to import form that file i use in css.
- in function return we use parenthesis `()`;
- if i need js const in function i need to take const or variable in the
  function `{}`
- in `{}` we can use js builtIn function also.
- we use javascript function like uppercase function.
- if we use image in react we have to import image first, than use in js
  variable name by calling.
- we use proops as JS object.
- using proops we can pass new value in the component.
- using proops sring can be in `name="string"` but number should be in
  `age={26}`
- Default Prop will can show default set value.
- by prop calling we can call variable form other page.
- Remember we have to import the json file where we want to display the json
  file data.
- i learn how to all inside file from another file when i was practicing json
  data file mapping.
- i learn class component, it's similar like functional component.
- i was using constructor function out side of class component and that was my
  fault.
- i was using two return and it show error i should have used one return.
- we also can use ternary operator in the return directely.
- i learn in form if i use `required` without data passing form can't be
  submitted.
- i learn with `ctrl + F5` i can clear cash in the browser.
- i was using `{}` in map function, and i was wrong i should use `()`
- ([...todo]) we use sprade operator use it will show also before all todo and
  right now todo.
- i have learn sometimes if i add unnecessary `import` in the page can show
  error or not run the page.
- i have face error when i do't use `uuid` form web site but form video cause
  maybe it wasn't update code.
- i import `React` 2nd time again and it was crush the page. (i should take
  `import react` only one time in a page).
- i learn if i don't make button function yet, a call the function in the button
  it will show error in the whole page.
- i was using {{} && {}} and it won't work it should be like {{} && <p>{}</p>}  
- If we want to pass key to a Fragment, we canâ€™t use the <>...</> syntax.
  we have to explicitly import Fragment from 'react' and render <Fragment key={yourKey}>...</Fragment>.
